# CustomTKinter-Text-To-Speech-Converter
This is just a simple GUI app that lets You paste code on the text area and it reads it out to you
Currently has some cool features as 

1. buttons to change the voice between a male and female's voice
2. increase the rate at which the reading is done
3. increase and decrease the volume
More features will be added.
I made this in order learn how the customTkinter library works and feels on my fingertips :)
